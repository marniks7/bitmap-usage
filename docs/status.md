There are a lot of (too much) ideas around testing, benchmarking, improvements, functionality, this might be finished, might be not.
Who knows :)

## Bitmap implementations
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Roaring 32 bit|This is the primary goal of this repo to test it|
|Roaring 64 bit|Added for comparison to sroar and Pilosa. Note, this might not have up-to-date changes|
|Sroar|First impression - huge degradation compared to other bitmaps. Note, this might not have up-to-date changes|
|Pilosa|TBD|

## Other
Bulk not finished from performance perspective
